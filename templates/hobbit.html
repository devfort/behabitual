  <a href="#TODO">13 geeks</a> went to live in a Napoleonic sea fort for a week. They ate good
  food, drank copious amounts of booze, and made this website.
</p>

  It turns out, however, that this environment, whilst good for building
  websites, also rots the brain to the point that, by the end of the week,
  none of them were able to distinguish between “habits” and “hobbits”,
  precious.
